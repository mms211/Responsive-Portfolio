# Responsive-Portfolio

## Description

This Responsive-Portfolio was created so that I could showcase the projects I complete during my enrollment in the UPENN Coding Bootcamp, and share them with colleages and potential employers. This website was my first deep dive into building a website from scratch using HTML and CSS. This webite contains 3 pages, which include an About Me section, Contact Me form, and a Portfolio page which will eventually contain links to different projects. All pages are responsive to changes in browser size, and remained styled regardless of the device type.
